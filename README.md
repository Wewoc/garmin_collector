# Garmin Local Archive

Two scripts to archive and analyse your Garmin Connect data locally.
No cloud services, no third parties — everything runs on your own machine.

---

## Overview

```
garmin_data/
├── raw/        – full API dumps (~500 KB/day), kept as archive
└── summary/    – compact daily JSONs (~2 KB/day) → for Ollama / Open WebUI
```

| Script                  | Purpose                                        |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `garmin_collector.py`   | Fetch data from Garmin Connect and save locally |
| `garmin_to_excel.py`    | Export summary data as a formatted Excel file   |

---

## Requirements

### Python

Both scripts require Python 3.10 or newer. Check if installed:

```bash
python --version
```

If not installed: https://www.python.org/downloads/

> **Windows:** tick **"Add Python to PATH"** during installation, otherwise `python` won't be available in the terminal.

### Libraries

```bash
pip install garminconnect openpyxl
```

## garmin_collector.py

### What it does

- Connects to Garmin Connect
- Checks which days are missing locally (handles multiple folder layouts and legacy naming)
- Downloads missing days automatically (backfill + daily sync)
- Saves two files per day: full raw dump and compact summary

### Configuration (top of script)

| Variable           | Description                                      | Default            |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| `GARMIN_EMAIL`     | Your Garmin Connect login email                  | —                  |
| `GARMIN_PASSWORD`  | Your Garmin Connect password                     | —                  |
| `BASE_DIR`         | Root folder for all data                         | `~/garmin_data`    |
| `SYNC_START_DATE`  | Earliest date to backfill, e.g. `"2022-01-01"`  | 90-day fallback    |
| `REQUEST_DELAY`    | Pause between API requests (seconds)             | `1.5`              |

All settings can also be passed as environment variables instead of editing the script.

### Run manually

```bash
python garmin_collector.py
```

### Automate on login (Windows Task Scheduler)

```powershell
$action  = New-ScheduledTaskAction `
    -Execute "python.exe" `
    -Argument "C:\path\to\garmin_collector.py"

$trigger = New-ScheduledTaskTrigger -AtLogOn

Register-ScheduledTask -TaskName "GarminCollector" `
    -Action $action -Trigger $trigger -RunLevel Highest
```

With log output:
```powershell
-Argument "C:\path\to\garmin_collector.py >> C:\garmin_data\collector.log 2>&1"
```

### Automate on login (Linux/macOS cron)

```bash
crontab -e
# Add: runs daily at 07:00
0 7 * * * python3 /path/to/garmin_collector.py >> /path/to/garmin_data/collector.log 2>&1
```

### Data fields collected

- **Sleep:** phases, score, SpO2, respiration rate, HRV
- **Heart rate:** resting, min, max, average
- **Stress & Body Battery**
- **Steps, calories, distance, intensity minutes**
- **Training readiness, training status, 7-day load, VO2max**
- **Activities** (compact per activity)
- Race predictions, max metrics

## garmin_to_excel.py

### What it does

Reads all `garmin_YYYY-MM-DD.json` files from the `summary` folder and produces
a formatted Excel file with two sheets:

- **Garmin Daily Overview** — one row per day, colour-coded by category
- **Activities** — one row per activity (optional)

### Configuration (CONFIG block at top of script)

| Variable                  | Description                             |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `SUMMARY_DIR`             | Path to the summary folder              |
| `OUTPUT_FILE`             | Path and filename for the Excel output  |
| `DATE_FROM` / `DATE_TO`   | Date filter (`None` = export all)       |
| `FIELDS`                  | Toggle columns on/off (`True`/`False`)  |
| `EXPORT_ACTIVITIES_SHEET` | Include activities sheet (`True`/`False`) |

### Toggling columns

In the `FIELDS` block, set `True` or `False`:

```python
"sleep.light_h":     False,  # hide light sleep
"heartrate.avg_bpm": True,   # show average heart rate
```

Column order in the spreadsheet follows the order in `FIELDS`.

### Date filter

```python
DATE_FROM = "2025-01-01"   # from January 2025
DATE_TO   = "2025-12-31"   # until end of 2025
DATE_FROM = None            # no filter — export everything
```

### Run

```bash
python garmin_to_excel.py
```

## Maintenance

### Adding new fields from raw data

The `raw/` folder contains the complete API response for every day. If Garmin
adds new metrics or you want additional fields:

1. Open any `garmin_raw_YYYY-MM-DD.json` and locate the field
2. Add it to `summarize()` in `garmin_collector.py` under the appropriate category
3. Add the field key and label to `FIELDS` and `LABELS` in `garmin_to_excel.py`
4. Existing summary files do **not** need to be re-downloaded —
   they can be regenerated from the raw files without any API calls

### Re-fetching a specific day

Delete the corresponding `garmin_raw_YYYY-MM-DD.json` (and optionally the summary),
then run the collector again — it will re-fetch that day automatically.

### Rate limiting by Garmin

If Garmin throttles requests (many warnings, slow responses):
increase `REQUEST_DELAY` from `1.5` to `3.0`.

### Login fails / Captcha

On first run or after a long pause, Garmin may require browser-based
verification. Run the script manually in a terminal and follow the prompt.
Subsequent automated runs will work without interaction.

### Older Garmin devices (e.g. Vivosmart, Fenix 5)

Many fields will be `null` for older devices — this is expected.
Sleep, heart rate, and steps are available even with older hardware.
Set `SYNC_START_DATE` to control how far back to go:

```python
SYNC_START_DATE = "2018-06-01"
```

## Open WebUI / Ollama integration

Point the Knowledge Base at the `summary` folder:

1. Open WebUI → **Workspace** → **Knowledge** → **+ New**
2. Name: `Garmin Health Data`
3. Folder: path to your `summary` directory
4. In chat: type `#` → select the knowledge base

Example questions:
- *"How was my sleep and HRV last week?"*
- *"Which days had Body Battery below 30?"*
- *"Show me my VO2max trend over January."*
- *"When did I have the highest training load?"*
- *"Compare my resting heart rate this month vs last month."*
