## garmin_app.py (Target 1 + 2)

### Purpose

Desktop GUI built with tkinter. Wraps all scripts so the user never needs a terminal. Target 2 is distributed as a PyInstaller `.exe` — `scripts/` must stay next to it at runtime.

### Key design decisions

**Script execution** — scripts are run as subprocesses via a locally installed `python.exe`. `_find_python()` searches PATH and common Windows install locations. `_build_env()` sets all `GARMIN_*` environment variables before launching the subprocess.

**Configuration** — all config is passed via `os.environ` — no source patching, no temp files. `_build_env()` in `garmin_app.py` builds the full env dict from UI settings.

**Password security** — stored in Windows Credential Manager via `keyring`. Never written to the settings JSON or any temp file. Passed to subprocesses via `GARMIN_PASSWORD` env var only.

**Stop button** — only the collector has one. `self._active_proc` holds the subprocess reference. `_stop_collector()` calls `proc.terminate()`, waits 5 s, then `proc.kill()`.

**script_dir()** — returns `exe_folder/scripts/` when frozen (PyInstaller), `Path(__file__).parent` in dev mode.

**`_on_sync_mode_change()`** — callback bound to the Sync Mode combobox. Dims/enables the four sync fields (Days, From, To, Fallback) based on the selected mode. Called on every combobox change and once at startup via `_load_settings_to_ui()` to set the correct initial state.

**`_toggle_log_level()`** — toggles between `INFO` (Simple) and `DEBUG` (Detailed) GUI log display. Updates the button label and colour. If a sync is running when toggled, a yellow hint label appears above the button reading "Takes effect on next sync" — no restart occurs. The hint disappears automatically when the next sync starts. The current level is passed to subprocesses via `GARMIN_LOG_LEVEL` in `_build_env()`. Session log files always run at DEBUG regardless of this toggle.

**`_check_failed_days_popup()`** — called at the start of every `_run_collector()` call. Reads `log/quality_log.json` and counts `failed`+`low` entries with `recheck=true` within the current sync date range. If any are found, shows a German-language popup: "Es gibt fehlerhafte Datensätze: X Tage im gewählten Zeitraum — Aktualisieren?" If the user clicks Ja, `GARMIN_REFRESH_FAILED=1` is set in the ENV and the collector re-fetches those days.

**`_clean_archive()`** — reads `first_day` from `log/quality_log.json` and builds a list of all `raw/` and `summary/` files before that date. Opens a popup with a scrollable file list and a summary count. Deletes files and removes corresponding quality log entries only after the user confirms with "Löschen". Aborts silently on "Abbrechen". If `first_day` is not yet set or nothing is found before it, logs an informational message and returns without opening the popup.

**`_connection_verified`** — session flag, starts `False`. Set to `True` after the first successful connection test. `_run_collector()` skips the test on subsequent calls and starts the sync directly. Resets to `False` on app restart.

**Background Timer** — runs in a daemon thread started by `_toggle_timer()`. Cycles through three modes per run:
- **Repair:** reads `quality_log.json`, draws a random subset (min–max days, configurable) of `failed` days with `recheck=true`, fetches them with `GARMIN_REFRESH_FAILED=1` and `GARMIN_SYNC_DATES`.
- **Quality:** reads `quality_log.json`, draws a random subset of `low` days with `recheck=true`, re-downloads them to check if Garmin now returns better data. After `LOW_QUALITY_MAX_ATTEMPTS` attempts without improvement, the day's `recheck` is set to `false` — Garmin no longer has the detailed data and the day leaves the queue permanently.
- **Fill:** scans `raw/` for dates completely absent from both the filesystem and the quality log — true gaps never downloaded. Fetches them normally.

Cycle order: Repair → Quality → Fill → Repair → ... If a mode's queue is empty it is skipped. If all three queues are empty the timer stops automatically.

**Timer settings** — four fields in the GUI (BACKGROUND TIMER section, right panel), stored in `~/.garmin_archive_settings.json`:

| Setting | Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| Min. Interval (min) | `timer_min_interval` | `5` | Shortest wait between runs |
| Max. Interval (min) | `timer_max_interval` | `30` | Longest wait between runs |
| Min. Tage pro Run | `timer_min_days` | `3` | Fewest days fetched per run |
| Max. Tage pro Run | `timer_max_days` | `10` | Most days fetched per run |

Values are read fresh at the start of each run — changing them while the timer is running takes effect immediately on the next run without restarting.

**Thread safety** — each timer thread carries a `generation` integer. `_timer_generation` is incremented on every Start/Stop. A thread exits immediately if its generation no longer matches (`_stale()` check). This prevents ghost threads from multiple rapid Start/Stop clicks.

**`_timer_conn_verified`** — session flag for the timer's own connection test. On success, also sets `_connection_verified = True` and updates all three GUI indicators to green — so a subsequent manual sync also skips its test.

**Timer + manual sync interaction** — `_run_collector()` detects `_timer_active`, pauses the timer (increments generation, sets stop event), runs the manual sync, then resumes via `_timer_resume_after_sync()` in `on_done`. Timer Stop during an active timer sync sets `_stopped_by_user = True` — no false error log.

**Session logs** — background timer syncs write to `log/recent/garmin_background_YYYY-MM-DD_HHMMSS.log`. The `garmin_background_` prefix makes the source immediately identifiable in `log/fail/`.

**`_set_indicator(key, state)`** — updates a connection status dot. States: `"pending"` (orange), `"ok"` (green), `"fail"` (red), `"reset"` (grey).

**`_run_connection_test()`** — runs three sequential checks in a background thread: Login → API Access (`get_user_profile`) → Data (`get_stats` for yesterday). Each indicator updates live as checks complete. Button turns green on full success, red on first failure. Stops immediately on failure — no point testing further if login fails.

### Settings file

`~/.garmin_archive_settings.json` — all settings except password. Password field is stripped on save and removed on load (migration from older versions that stored it in plaintext).

---

## garmin_app_standalone.py (Target 3)

### Purpose

Identical to `garmin_app.py` with two differences that make it work without a local Python installation.

### Key differences from garmin_app.py

**`_find_python()`** — always returns `sys.executable`. In a PyInstaller standalone EXE, `sys.executable` is the EXE itself, which contains the embedded Python interpreter.

**`script_dir()`** — returns `Path(sys._MEIPASS) / "scripts"`. PyInstaller unpacks `--add-data` files to `sys._MEIPASS` at runtime. Scripts land in `sys._MEIPASS/scripts/`.

**`_run_module()` instead of `_run_script()`** — does not use subprocesses. Scripts are loaded with `importlib.util.spec_from_file_location()` and `main()` is called directly in a background thread. This avoids the problem where `sys.executable` would re-launch the GUI EXE instead of a Python interpreter.

**Output capture** — `sys.stdout`, `sys.stderr`, and the root logger are redirected to a `queue.Queue` via `_QueueWriter` and `_QueueHandler`. A 50ms poll (`_poll_log_queue`) drains the queue and writes lines to the GUI log.

**Stop mechanism** — `self._stop_event` is a `threading.Event`. `_stop_collector()` sets it. `garmin_collector.py` checks `_is_stopped()` at the top of each day loop and inside `api_call()`.

**`_apply_env()`** — writes directly to `os.environ` instead of building a dict. Must run before the module is imported since scripts read `os.environ.get()` at module level.

**`_toggle_log_level()`** — identical to `garmin_app.py`. Hint label shown above button if sync is running. No restart. Session logs unaffected.

**`_check_failed_days_popup()`** — identical to `garmin_app.py`. `refresh_failed` is passed to `_run_module()` which passes it to `_apply_env()`.

**`_connection_verified`** — identical behaviour to `garmin_app.py`. Session flag, skips connection test on subsequent sync starts.

**`_set_indicator()` / `_run_connection_test()`** — identical logic to `garmin_app.py`. In standalone mode log output goes via `self._log_queue` instead of `self.after(0, self._log, ...)` to stay thread-safe with the queue pump.

---

## garmin_collector.py

### Purpose

Connects to Garmin Connect, determines which days are missing locally, and downloads them. Runs unattended via Task Scheduler / cron after initial setup.

### Two-layer design

Every day produces two files:

- `raw/garmin_raw_YYYY-MM-DD.json` — complete API response for all endpoints (~500 KB). Never modified after creation. Serves as the permanent source of truth.
- `summary/garmin_YYYY-MM-DD.json` — compact distillation (~2 KB). Used by Open WebUI / Ollama as a Knowledge Base. Can always be regenerated from raw without hitting the API again.

### Quality tracking and the quality log

Every raw file downloaded from Garmin is assessed for content quality immediately after writing. The result is stored in `log/quality_log.json` — a persistent register of every day the collector has ever seen.

**Why content-based quality instead of file size:**
Garmin Connect stores intraday detail data (per-second heart rate, per-minute stress values, sleep stage details) for approximately 1–2 years. Older data returns only daily aggregates — the API responds successfully, the JSON is valid, but it contains far less than a recent day. A file size threshold cannot reliably distinguish between a genuinely incomplete download and a legitimately sparse historical record. Content inspection can.

**Quality levels** (`assess_quality(raw)` in `garmin_collector.py`):

| Level | Condition | Background Timer |
|---|---|---|
| `high` | Intraday data present — `heart_rates.heartRateValues` or `stress.stressValuesArray` has entries | Never re-downloaded |
| `med` | Daily aggregates present (`stats.totalSteps` etc.) but no intraday — typical for data > ~1 year old | Never re-downloaded — this is as good as it gets |
| `low` | Only minimal stats present — summary-level minimum | Re-tried up to `LOW_QUALITY_MAX_ATTEMPTS` (default 3) times, then left alone |
| `failed` | API error — no usable data returned | Re-tried indefinitely until successful |

**The `recheck` flag** controls whether the background timer will attempt to re-download a day:
- `high` and `med` → always `recheck=false`
- `low` → `recheck=true` until `attempts >= LOW_QUALITY_MAX_ATTEMPTS`, then `recheck=false`
- `failed` → always `recheck=true`

This prevents the timer from endlessly retrying days where Garmin simply no longer has the detailed data.

**Startup scan:** On each run, `main()` loads the quality log and collects all already-known dates. Only raw files **not** in the log are read for quality assessment — this avoids triggering cloud downloads (OneDrive, etc.) for files that have already been assessed. The first run after installation scans everything; subsequent runs only scan new files.

**Migration:** On the first run after upgrading from an older version, `_load_quality_log()` automatically reads the old `failed_days.json`, converts it to the new schema, writes `quality_log.json`, and deletes the old file.

Stop-aborted days are never added to the quality log — only real failures and completed (even if low-quality) downloads.

### Session logging

Every sync run opens a new log file at `log/recent/`. The filename prefix is controlled by `GARMIN_SESSION_LOG_PREFIX`:
- Manual syncs: `garmin_YYYY-MM-DD_HHMMSS.log`
- Background timer syncs: `garmin_background_YYYY-MM-DD_HHMMSS.log`

The file handler always runs at `DEBUG` level. After the run:
- If the session had errors or low-quality downloads: the log is additionally copied to `log/fail/` — the prefix immediately identifies the source
- `log/recent/` is capped at 30 files — oldest are deleted automatically
- `log/fail/` has no automatic limit

### Stop support (standalone mode)

`_is_stopped()` checks `globals().get("_STOP_EVENT")`. In standalone mode, `garmin_app_standalone.py` injects a `threading.Event` into the module dict before calling `main()`. In all other modes the key is absent and `_is_stopped()` always returns `False` — no effect on Target 1 or 2.

Stop is checked in two places: at the top of the day loop, and at the start of each `api_call()`.

### Sync modes

| Mode | Behaviour |
|------|-----------|
| `"recent"` | Checks last `SYNC_DAYS` days (default 90). Good for daily automation. |
| `"range"` | Checks `SYNC_FROM` to `SYNC_TO` only. Good for targeted backfills. |
| `"auto"` | Checks from `first_day` (stored in `quality_log.json`) to today. On first run, `first_day` is detected from registered devices → account profile → `SYNC_AUTO_FALLBACK`. After that, reads directly from the log — no API call needed. |

### Key functions

`fetch_raw(client, date_str)` — calls all Garmin API endpoints for a given date. To add a new endpoint, append a tuple `("method_name", (args,), "key_name")` to the `endpoints` list.

`assess_quality(raw)` — inspects raw data content and returns `"high"`, `"med"`, `"low"`, or `"failed"`. Called after every download.

`summarize(raw)` — extracts fields from raw into compact summary. To expose a new field in Open WebUI, add it here.

`_parse_device_date(val)` — converts a device date value to `YYYY-MM-DD`. Handles ISO strings, Unix second timestamps (~10 digits), and Unix millisecond timestamps (~13 digits). Used by `get_devices()` and the migration in `_load_quality_log()`.

`get_devices(client)` — fetches registered devices, logs first/last use dates. Uses `_parse_device_date()` to normalise all date values. Called on every successful login to keep the `devices` list in `quality_log.json` current.

`resolve_date_range(client)` — returns `(start, end)` based on `SYNC_MODE`. Auto mode: reads `first_day` from `quality_log.json` first — if set, returns it directly without calling the API. Falls back to devices → account profile → `SYNC_AUTO_FALLBACK` → 90-day fallback.

`get_local_dates(folder)` — scans across three locations and naming schemes for robustness. If `REFRESH_FAILED=True`, excludes days with `recheck=true` from the quality log.

`get_low_quality_dates(folder, known_dates)` — scans `raw/` for files not yet in the quality log. Skips `known_dates` to avoid triggering cloud downloads.

`_load_quality_log()` — loads `quality_log.json`. Migrates old `failed_days.json` on first run. Adds missing root fields (`first_day`, `devices`) if absent. Converts any timestamp-format `first_day` or device dates to ISO via `_parse_device_date()`.

`_save_quality_log(data)` — writes atomically via `.tmp` file.

`_upsert_quality(data, day, quality, reason)` — adds or updates entry. Increments `attempts` for `failed` and `low`. Sets `recheck=false` for `low` after `LOW_QUALITY_MAX_ATTEMPTS`.

`_mark_quality_ok(data, day, quality)` — marks day as `high` or `med`, sets `recheck=false`.

`_backfill_quality_log(data)` — one-time backfill run when `first_day` is not yet set. Scans all existing `raw/` files (including `high` and `med` quality) and adds any not yet in the quality log. Ensures the log is complete before `first_day` is determined.

`_set_first_day(data, client)` — determines and persists `first_day` in `quality_log.json`. Resolution order: `devices` list already in `data` → account profile → `SYNC_AUTO_FALLBACK` → oldest entry in `data["days"]`. Never overwrites an existing `first_day` value.

`cleanup_before_first_day(data, dry_run)` — deletes all `raw/` and `summary/` files before `first_day` and removes corresponding quality log entries. `dry_run=True` returns counts without deleting. Called by the GUI's Clean Archive button.

`_start_session_log()` — opens session log at DEBUG. Returns `(handler, path)`.

`_close_session_log(fh, path, had_errors, had_incomplete)` — closes handler, copies to `log/fail/` if needed, enforces rolling limit.

### Configuration variables

| Variable | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `GARMIN_EMAIL` | str | Garmin Connect login email |
| `GARMIN_PASSWORD` | str | Garmin Connect password |
| `BASE_DIR` | Path | Root folder; `raw/`, `summary/`, and `log/` live here |
| `SYNC_MODE` | str | `"recent"`, `"range"`, or `"auto"` |
| `SYNC_DAYS` | int | Days to check in `"recent"` mode (default 90) |
| `SYNC_FROM` | str | Start date for `"range"` mode (`"YYYY-MM-DD"`) |
| `SYNC_TO` | str | End date for `"range"` mode (`"YYYY-MM-DD"`) |
| `SYNC_AUTO_FALLBACK` | str/None | Manual start date fallback for `"auto"` mode |
| `REQUEST_DELAY` | float | Seconds between API calls (default 1.5) |
| `INCOMPLETE_FILE_KB` | int | Raw file size threshold in KB (default 100) |
| `REFRESH_FAILED` | bool | If True, incomplete days are re-fetched in this run |
| `GARMIN_LOG_LEVEL` | str | GUI display level only — session logs always run at DEBUG |

### Known Garmin API quirks

- `get_fitnessAge()` does not exist in current `garminconnect` library versions — removed from endpoints list.
- `get_devices()` may return non-dict entries — filtered with `isinstance(d, dict)` check.
- **Stress data** lives in `stress.stressValuesArray` as `[timestamp_ms, value]` pairs. `stressChartValueOffset` may be present — subtract it. Negative results = unmeasured, filtered out.
- **Body Battery** lives in `stress.bodyBatteryValuesArray` as `[timestamp_ms, "MEASURED", level, version]`. Level is at index 2.
- Login may require browser captcha on first run or after long inactivity — run manually in terminal to complete.

## garmin_to_excel.py

### Purpose

Reads all `summary/garmin_YYYY-MM-DD.json` files and produces a formatted daily overview Excel file.

### Structure

- Sheet 1 **Garmin Daily Overview** — one row per day, columns toggled via `FIELDS` dict.
- Sheet 2 **Activities** — one row per activity entry (optional, `EXPORT_ACTIVITIES_SHEET`).

### Adding a new column

1. Ensure the field exists in the summary JSON (add to `summarize()` in collector if not).
2. Add entry to `FIELDS` dict: `"section.field_name": True`.
3. Add human-readable label to `LABELS` dict.

### Configuration variables

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `SUMMARY_DIR` | Path to `summary/` folder |
| `OUTPUT_FILE` | Output `.xlsx` path |
| `DATE_FROM` / `DATE_TO` | Date filter; `None` exports everything |
| `FIELDS` | Dict of `"section.field": True/False` |
| `EXPORT_ACTIVITIES_SHEET` | Whether to include the activities sheet |

---

## garmin_timeseries_excel.py

### Purpose

Reads `raw/garmin_raw_YYYY-MM-DD.json` files and exports full intraday measurement points to Excel. Per metric: one data table sheet + one line chart sheet.

### Metrics and extractors

| Metric key | Extractor function | Source field in raw JSON |
|---|---|---|
| `heart_rate` | `extract_heart_rate()` | `heart_rates.heartRateValues` |
| `stress` | `extract_stress()` | `stress.stressValuesArray` |
| `spo2` | `extract_spo2()` | `spo2.spO2HourlyAverages` or `continuousReadingDTOList` |
| `body_battery` | `extract_body_battery()` | `stress.bodyBatteryValuesArray` |
| `respiration` | `extract_respiration()` | `respiration.respirationValuesArray` |

### Adding a new metric

1. Write an extractor function returning `list of (date_str, time_str, value)`.
2. Add to `EXTRACTORS` dict.
3. Add display name and unit to `METRIC_LABELS`.
4. Add fill colour to `METRIC_COLORS`, chart colour to `CHART_COLORS`.
5. Add `True` entry to `METRICS` config block.

> Excel becomes slow with many data points. For ranges longer than ~30 days, use the HTML dashboard instead.

---

## garmin_timeseries_html.py

### Purpose

Reads `raw/garmin_raw_YYYY-MM-DD.json` files and generates a self-contained interactive HTML file using Plotly. One tab per metric, fully zoomable, range selector and drag-to-zoom. Works offline after first load.

### Data flow

```
raw JSON files
    → load_raw_files()         – loads files within date range
    → EXTRACTORS[metric](raw)  – per-metric extraction (same logic as Excel script)
    → build_html(metric_data)  – generates complete HTML string with embedded JS data
    → write to OUTPUT_FILE
```

### Adding a new metric

Same steps as for the Excel script. Additionally update `METRIC_META` with label, unit, and hex colour for the chart line.

---

## garmin_analysis_html.py

### Purpose

Reads `summary/garmin_YYYY-MM-DD.json` files and generates:

- `garmin_analysis.html` — interactive dashboard: daily value + 90-day personal baseline + age/fitness reference range band per metric
- `garmin_analysis.json` — compact summary for Ollama / Open WebUI with flagged days

### How it works

```
summary JSONs
    → load_summaries()              – loads display range + extra days for baseline
    → auto-detect VO2max            – scans most recent non-null training.vo2max
    → get_reference_ranges()        – builds age/sex/fitness norm bands
    → analyse()                     – computes daily values, baselines, flags
    → build_html()                  – generates Plotly dashboard
    → build_ollama_summary()        – generates compact JSON for AI context
```

### Reference range sources

| Metric | Source | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| HRV | Shaffer & Ginsberg 2017, Garmin whitepaper | Age + sex + fitness adjusted |
| Resting HR | AHA guidelines | Fitness adjusted |
| SpO2 | WHO, AHA | Fixed range 95–100% |
| Sleep | National Sleep Foundation 2023 | Age adjusted |
| Body Battery | Garmin guidance | No external norm; >50 = adequate |
| Stress | Garmin scale | 0–50 = low/rest; >50 = elevated |

### Adding a new metric

1. Add the summary key to `METRIC_KEYS` dict.
2. Add display name and chart colour to `METRIC_META`.
3. Add reference range logic to `get_reference_ranges()`.
4. Set `higher_better` appropriately (`True`, `False`, or `None` for range).

### Configuration variables

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `SUMMARY_DIR` | Path to `summary/` folder |
| `OUTPUT_HTML` | Output `.html` path |
| `OUTPUT_JSON` | Output `.json` path for Ollama |
| `DATE_FROM` | Start date (`"YYYY-MM-DD"`) |
| `DATE_TO` | End date (`"YYYY-MM-DD"`) |
| `PROFILE` | Dict with `age` (int) and `sex` (`"male"`/`"female"`) |
| `BASELINE_DAYS` | Rolling average window (default 90) |

## Common maintenance tasks

### Re-generating summaries from raw data (no API call needed)

```bash
python regenerate_summaries.py
```

Run this whenever `summarize()` in `garmin_collector.py` is updated.

### Re-fetching a specific day

Delete `raw/garmin_raw_YYYY-MM-DD.json` (and `summary/garmin_YYYY-MM-DD.json` if it exists), then run the collector — it re-fetches automatically.

### Inspecting failed days

Open `log/quality_log.json` in any text editor or JSON viewer. The file lists all known days with their quality level, recheck flag, and attempt count. To force a re-fetch, start a sync and click "Ja" in the popup, or manually delete the raw file for that day.

`first_day` and `devices` are stored as root fields at the top of the file.

### Inspecting session logs

`log/recent/` contains the last 30 sync sessions at full DEBUG detail. `log/fail/` contains all sessions that had errors or incomplete days — these are never deleted automatically.

### Rate limiting

If Garmin throttles requests: increase `REQUEST_DELAY` from `1.5` to `3.0`.

### Login / captcha issues

Garmin may require browser-based MFA on first run or after long inactivity. Run `garmin_collector.py` manually in a terminal and follow any prompts. After that the GUI versions work normally.

### Older devices (Vivosmart 3, Fenix 5)

Many fields return `null` — expected behaviour. Use `SYNC_AUTO_FALLBACK = "2018-06-01"` with `SYNC_MODE = "auto"` to control how far back to go.

### Removing the stored password

Open **Windows Credential Manager** → **Windows Credentials** → find `GarminLocalArchive` → delete.

### Clean uninstall

Deleting the app folder is not enough — two items remain on your system:

1. **Stored password** — Windows Credential Manager → Windows Credentials → find `GarminLocalArchive` → delete
2. **Settings file** — delete `C:\Users\YourName\.garmin_archive_settings.json`

Your data folder (`garmin_data/` or wherever you configured it) is never touched automatically — delete it manually if you no longer want the archived data.

### Pylance / VS Code import warning

The `garminconnect` import warning is cosmetic. Click the interpreter selector (bottom right in VS Code) and match it to `where python` in the terminal.

### Building a new release

**Target 2 — Standard EXE (Python required):**

```bash
python build.py
```

Produces `Garmin_Local_Archive.exe` and `Garmin_Local_Archive.zip`.

**Target 3 — Standalone EXE (no Python required):**

```bash
python build_standalone.py
```

Produces `Garmin_Local_Archive_Standalone.exe` and `Garmin_Local_Archive_Standalone.zip`.

Both scripts auto-migrate files to the correct subfolders if still in root. Safe to run from any starting layout. Upload both ZIPs to the GitHub release page.

### Adding a missing hidden import to the standalone build

If the standalone EXE fails with an `ImportError` or `ModuleNotFoundError`, add the missing module name to the `hidden` list in `build_exe()` inside `build_standalone.py`, then rebuild.
