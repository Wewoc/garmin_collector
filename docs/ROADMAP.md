# Garmin Local Archive — Roadmap

> This is a hobby project built and maintained by one person without a programming background.  
> There are no deadlines, no guarantees, and no support obligations — development happens when it happens, and it may take a while.  
> Features get built when they get built.

### v1.4.7 — Documentation, AI Usability & Pipeline Hardening

Two focused tracks: making the project easier to use and understand, and
closing known silent-failure gaps in the dashboard pipeline.

#### Documentation & AI Usability

- **AI prompts** — provide ready-to-use system prompts for local AI tools (Ollama / AnythingLLM) to correctly interpret `garmin_analysis.json` (quality flags, HRV meaning, stress direction, etc.)
- **Documentation reorganization** — split into clear user, developer, and AI-focused sections (`USER_GUIDE.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `AI_CONTEXT.md`) with improved navigation, reduced redundancy, and a unified structure that makes the project easier to understand, maintain, and safely extend.
  - README structure: move AI-assisted analysis (Step 11) up directly after the philosophy section — the end result (asking an AI about your health data) should be visible before the technical pipeline details
  - "What is included" script table moved to end of README or fully into `MAINTENANCE.md` — relevant for developers, not for first-time users
  - Standalone troubleshooting: replace all CMD-based instructions with log file navigation via Windows Explorer — point users to `log/fail/` in Notepad instead of a terminal
- **Warnings & disclaimers** — make health-related limitations and AI interpretation risks more prominent in README and dashboards
- **`first_day` caution** — clarify in documentation that `first_day` in `quality_log.json` is **not protected against manual JSON edits or environment variable overrides**; changes can create gaps or inconsistent archival data.
- **Integrity notes** — mention that **no checksums or signatures are currently applied** to `quality_log.json`; modifications or corruption are not automatically detected — users should handle backups carefully.
- **README_APP consolidation — merge** `README_APP.md` and `README_APP_Standalone.md` into a single file with a small Standard/Standalone-specific block; ~80% of content is identical, two files create maintenance overhead (changes must be applied twice).
- **Timer documentation — Background Timer** section in both READMEs documents only Repair + Fill; Quality mode (re-checks `low` days) is missing from user-facing docs.

#### Pipeline Hardening

**`dash_runner.py` — `_load_plotters()` silent failure**

`_load_plotters()` currently swallows import errors with `except Exception: pass`.
A plotter that fails to load simply disappears from the registry — no message,
no trace. The format is missing in the GUI popup with no explanation.

Fix: store the error string in `plotters[f"{fmt}_err"]` instead of discarding it.
`scan()` and `build()` can surface these on demand (e.g. as a log warning during
`build()` when a format is requested but its plotter has an `_err` entry).
This converts a permanent silent gap into a visible, diagnosable failure.

**Broker contract — `field_map` / `garmin_map` (`test_dashboard.py`)**

`garmin_map.get()` returns a dict with an implicit contract: `values`, `fallback`,
`source_resolution`, optional `error`. This contract is documented but never
asserted. New test section in `test_dashboard.py`:

- `garmin_map.get()` returns a dict with all required keys for known fields
- `values` is always a list
- `fallback` is always a bool
- `source_resolution` is always a string
- Unknown field raises `KeyError` (tested — used by `field_map` to skip silently)

**Broker contract — `context_map` / `weather_map` / `pollen_map` (`test_local_context.py`)**

Same pattern, same contract. New test section in `test_local_context.py`:

- `weather_map.get()` and `pollen_map.get()` return dicts with all required keys
- Contract assertions identical to `garmin_map` above
- Unknown field raises `KeyError`

**Specialist return contract (`test_dashboard.py`)**

`dash_runner.build()` passes the specialist `build()` return dict directly to
`plotter.render()` without structural validation. Every plotter implicitly assumes:
`daily` is a list, each entry has `date`, `meta` has `date_from` / `date_to`.
A specialist returning a malformed dict currently fails inside the plotter —
far from the actual source. New test section in `test_dashboard.py`:

- Every `*_dash.py` `build()` is called with a valid test range and mock settings
- Return dict contains `daily` (list) and `meta` (dict)
- Every entry in `daily` contains at minimum a `date` key
- `meta` contains `date_from` and `date_to`

No new production code — all hardening lives in the test suites.

---

### v1.4.8 — Daily Sync (Automated Daily Workflow)

Automated daily workflow as a standalone tool — no GUI, no manual interaction.
After initial setup in the desktop app, `daily_update` becomes the only daily
touchpoint with the system.

#### What it does

1. Call `garmin_collector` with date range: yesterday → yesterday
2. Call `context_collector` with date range: yesterday → yesterday
3. Call `dash_runner.build()` for all dashboards
4. Close the console window if everything completed cleanly

No new date logic, no new orchestration — existing collectors and runner
are called with parameters. `daily_update` is a thin entry point, not a
second orchestrator.

#### Gap detection

On each run `daily_update` checks the last successful sync date and acts
accordingly:

| Gap | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| ≤ 7 days | Closes the gap automatically — syncs all missing days |
| > 7 days | Hard stop — "X days missing, please open the app to sync" |

Keeps `daily_update` self-healing for normal interruptions (holiday,
machine off) without replicating Background Timer logic or introducing
a second orchestrator.

#### Console behaviour

| State | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| All OK | Console window closes automatically |
| New version available | Window stays open — yellow notice |
| Error | Window stays open — red notice |
| Migration required | Window stays open — hard stop, open the app |
| Settings missing | Window stays open — hard stop, open the app |

No silent failures. The window closing is the success signal.

Exit codes for Task Scheduler integration:

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 0 | Success |
| 1 | Migration required |
| 2 | Settings missing |
| 3 | API / Sync error |
| 4 | Dashboard error |

#### Delivery per build target

| Target | GUI | Daily Update |
|---|---|---|
| T1 — Dev/Scripts | `python garmin_app.py` | `python daily_update.py` or via `.bat` |
| T2 — Standard EXE | `Garmin_Local_Archive.exe` | `daily_update.bat` (calls `python daily_update.py`) |
| T3.1 — Standalone GUI | `Garmin_Local_Archive.exe` | — |
| T3.2 — Standalone headless | — | `daily_update.exe` |

T3.1 and T3.2 ship in the same ZIP — one download, both tools included.

#### Shared config

Both T3 executables read from the same `~/.garmin_archive_settings.json` and
the same Windows Credential Manager entry. Configure once in T3.1 — T3.2 picks
it up automatically. No duplicate setup.

#### Onboarding flow

```
1. Open T3.1 — enter email, password, folder, location → Save Settings
2. Run Bulk Import — full history
3. Run Sync Garmin + Sync Context once manually — archive up to date
4. Add daily_update.exe to Windows Task Scheduler → done
```

`daily_update` is step 4, not step 1. Running it before the app has been
configured once results in a hard stop with a clear message including the
expected settings file path and the name of the app to open.

#### Logging

Dedicated folder `BASE_DIR/log/daily/` — rolling 30 files, same mechanism
as `log/recent/`.

#### Task Scheduler setup notes (documentation)

Three settings to document for users configuring Windows Task Scheduler:

1. **"Run task as soon as possible after a scheduled start is missed"** — ensures the sync runs after waking from sleep even if the scheduled time was missed.
2. **"Do not restart on failure"** — prevents a restart loop from flooding `log/daily/` with error files within minutes.
3. **Run once daily, in the morning** — running more frequently than once per day is unnecessary and risks Garmin API rate limits (HTTP 429).

These are documentation items only — no code changes required.

A ready-to-import Task Scheduler XML template ships in `info/` (T2/T3)
and `docs/` (T1) — users import it once into Windows Task Scheduler.

**Auto-fill on Save Settings:** when the user clicks Save Settings in the
app, the XML template is automatically updated with the correct absolute
path to the `daily_update` entry point for that build target. No manual
editing required.

Path resolution uses the existing frozen-check pattern already used
throughout the project:

- T1 — `Path(__file__).parent / "docs"` → `daily_update.py`
- T2/T3 — `Path(sys.executable).parent / "info"` → `daily_update.bat` / `daily_update.exe`

`daily_update.py` lives in the project root alongside `garmin_app.py`.
No T1 ZIP — T1 users work directly in the repo.

#### Operational policy layer

Gap rules, exit code mapping, and stop conditions currently live in
`daily_update`. If GUI, Background Timer, and Daily Sync ever need to share
the same operational rules, this logic moves to a dedicated `sync_policy.py`
— consistent with the v2.0 global actor pattern (`sync.py`). No duplication,
no divergence. Noted here as the natural migration path when the time comes.

#### Build

Two entry points, one build run, one output folder. `build_manifest.py` gets
a second entry point definition. `build_standalone.py` builds both executables
sequentially. No additional maintenance overhead — identical codebase,
different packaging.

#### Implementation note — ENV loading order (T3.2)

T3.2 has no Python subprocess available — collector runs as a thread, not a
child process. `garmin_config` reads `os.environ` at import time, not
dynamically. This means ENVs must be set via `os.environ` *before*
`garmin_config` is imported — exactly the pattern already used in
`garmin_app_standalone.py` via `_apply_env()`.

`daily_update` must follow this same pattern. Any deviation would silently
use default config values instead of the user's settings — a classic silent
failure. The `_apply_env()` implementation in `garmin_app_standalone.py` is
the reference.

## Planned — v1.5

### v1.5 — Archive Integrity & Backup

Protection of the local archive against software errors and silent data loss — independent of OS-level backup.

**`quality_log.json`**

- **Monthly backup** — `_save_quality_log()` creates a snapshot once per month as `quality_log_YYYY-MM.zip` in `log/backup/`. On the first save of a new year, the previous year is consolidated into `quality_log_YYYY.zip` and all monthly zips for that year are removed.
- **Per-year checksums** — on every save, a SHA-256 hash is computed over all `days` entries for each calendar year and stored in a `checksums` block inside `quality_log.json`. On load, all completed years are verified — a mismatch triggers a warning in the log and GUI indicating which year is affected and where the backup is located.

**`raw/`** — incremental backup of newly written files. Motivation: Garmin degrades intraday data in stages (full resolution → reduced → summaries only), with the high-resolution window covering only the most recent ~6 months — the local raw copy is then the only source. A software bug in the writer that overwrites or corrupts a raw file is not recoverable without a backup. This is a direct extension of the data erosion protection that is a core promise of this project.

- Ownership: writer or a dedicated backup module — to be evaluated
- Strategy: incremental, newly written files only
- Scope and implementation to be defined after v1.4 is stable

**Mirror Backup (manual)** — a button in the GUI copies the full archive to a second location configured once in Settings (path, optional — leaving it empty disables the feature). On each run: destination is compared against source (filename + size), missing files are copied over. Follows the same manual trigger pattern as Sync Garmin and Sync Context — no automatic execution. Target location can be a NAS, external drive, or any local path. If the destination is unreachable, the operation logs a clear warning and exits cleanly.

### v1.5.1 — Content Validation

Value range checks implemented in v1.4.3 (`garmin_validator`, `garmin_collector` downgrade logic). Remaining scope: dashboard integration of flagged days, flagged day markers in charts, outlier visualization.

---

## Planned — v1.6

- **Garmin FIT Pipeline & Plugin Architecture**
The existing Garmin Health pipeline is being rebuilt into a plugin model — `garmin_map.py` → `garmin_health_map.py`, new `garmin_fit_map.py` as a second Garmin source (activity data via API + bulk import). `field_map.py` is being extended to become a source-agnostic broker. Goal: both Garmin sources run as equal pipelines side by side.

---

### Sync Mode "auto" — Deprecation Candidate

Sync mode `auto` fetches the complete history from `first_day` to yesterday
via the Garmin API. It was the original solution for building a full archive
before Bulk Import existed.

With the current toolset this use case is fully covered:

| Task | Tool |
|---|---|
| Complete history | Bulk Import — faster, no 429 risk |
| Gap repair | Background Timer |
| Daily updates | Daily Sync (v1.4.5) |

`auto` is no longer the recommended path for any standard workflow. It
remains functional but is not actively promoted. Removal or explicit
deprecation notice to be evaluated — not a priority while the mode causes
no active harm.


---

## Under consideration — v2.0

These are ideas, not commitments. Some may never get built.

**`GarminAppBase` — GUI Consolidation (Pre-v2.0 Preparation)**

`garmin_app.py` and `garmin_app_standalone.py` currently share identical GUI code but differ fundamentally in their execution model: Target 2 spawns subprocesses (`_run_script`), Target 3 imports modules directly in threads with queue-based output (`_run_module`). This means every GUI fix currently requires changes in two places.

The clean solution is a base class `GarminAppBase` in a shared `garmin_app_base.py` containing all GUI logic. Each target file then only defines what differs: `script_dir()`, `_find_python()`, and the run mechanism. This is a significant refactor — not a simple extraction — and requires careful handling of PyInstaller dependency detection and the `_STOP_EVENT` injection mechanism.

Intentionally deferred until v2.0 architecture is stable: the multi-source architecture will likely require further GUI changes, making it more efficient to consolidate once rather than twice.

---

**Multi-Source Architecture**

Extension to support multiple data sources (Strava, Komoot, ...) alongside Garmin. Full concept in `CONCEPT_V2-0.md`.

**Directory structure:** Each source gets its own isolated folder (`garmin_data/`, `strava_data/`, ...) with its own `raw/`, `summary/`, `log/`. A central `master/master_index.json` serves as a pure routing layer — which sources have data for a given day, and where. No logic, no decisions.

**Architecture principle — plugin modules:** Global actors (`writer`, `normalizer`, `sync`, `security`) remain source-agnostic. Each source provides a `*_master.py` plugin that delivers source-specific details on demand — paths, formats, validation rules, token location. Adding a new source means writing a new plugin and its source-specific actors (`*_api.py`, `*_quality.py`). All global actors work without modification.

**Translation layer:** `field_map.py` is the single point of truth for mapping fields between sources and the common schema. Dashboard and export scripts have no knowledge of source details — they only query `field_map`. Adding a new source means extending `field_map` — all scripts work automatically.

---

**Multiple User accounts**
Currently one account per Windows user. Switching between accounts requires manually changing credentials in Settings. Multi-account support would allow profiles per user.

**External factors & correlations**
Import external data (weather, activity logs, custom notes) and correlate with health metrics. Did poor sleep correlate with high stress? Did training load predict HRV drops?

**Adaptive Baselines**
Extend the Analysis Dashboard beyond fixed 90-day baselines. Rolling windows (7-day, 30-day), seasonal patterns, and load vs. recovery phase detection. The raw data is already there — this is purely an analytical layer on top of `garmin_analysis_html.py`.

**AI health report PDF**
Generate a formatted PDF health summary using the local AI model — personal baseline, flagged days, trends. Fully local, no cloud.

**Route heatmap**
Generate a local heatmap of GPS routes from activity data. No third-party mapping services.

**Windows notifications**
Toast notifications for sync completion, failed days, or significant metric changes.

**Stats dashboard & session log analysis**
Local overview of archive health built from session logs — days synced vs failed over time, which API endpoints fail most often, Garmin API response patterns by time of day. Builds on the Archive Info Panel (v1.3.1) and the quality data in `quality_log.json`. No extra API calls needed.

**Activities dashboard**
Training load, activity volume and sport-specific metrics (swim/bike/run) visualised over time. Activity data is already collected — it just isn't used beyond the summary.

**Test suite & CI/CD**
Core pipeline is covered by five test suites (218 + 134 + 211 + 80 checks + 8 sections for build output). Build integrity is covered by `validate_scripts()` in both build scripts and `test_build_output.py` as post-build gate. Full CI/CD with GitHub Actions for automated builds and release packaging is intentionally deferred — no timeline, no commitment, but the intention is there.

## Not planned

> These items are explicitly out of scope for v1.x but may be revisited for v2.0. No timeline, no commitment — but the intention is there.

- Cloud sync or remote access
- Mobile app
- Automatic data sharing, cloud sync, or social comparison features
- GUI and EXE are Windows-only and will remain so. The collector scripts work on Linux and macOS but are untested and unsupported — use at your own risk.
- Code signing or automatic updates
