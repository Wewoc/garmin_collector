## Pipeline architecture

```
garmin_app.py (GUI)
  └── _build_env() / _apply_env()
        └── garmin_collector.main()
              ├── garmin_quality._load_quality_log()
              ├── garmin_quality._backfill_quality_log()   (first run only)
              ├── garmin_quality.get_low_quality_dates()
              ├── bulk upgrade flagging                    (source:bulk + medium + ≤90d → recheck:true)
              ├── garmin_api.login()
              ├── garmin_api.get_devices()
              ├── garmin_quality._set_first_day()
              ├── garmin_sync.get_local_dates()            (bulk_upgrade_dates always excluded)

              │       ├── garmin_api.fetch_raw()
              │       ├── garmin_validator.validate()      → label:failed if critical

              │     downgrade check                        → skip write if new < existing
              │     garmin_collector._write_assessed()     → skipped on downgrade
              │     garmin_quality._upsert_quality()
              └── garmin_quality._save_quality_log()       (after every day)
```

### Module ownership

| Module | Sole write authority |
|---|---|
| `garmin_writer.py` | `raw/` and `summary/` |
| `garmin_quality.py` | `quality_log.json` |
| `garmin_security.py` | `garmin_token.enc` |

### Invariants

- `garmin_validator.py` always runs before `garmin_normalizer.py`
- `garmin_utils.py` and `garmin_validator.py` are leaf nodes — no project-module imports
- `QUALITY_LOCK` must be held around all load-modify-save sequences on `quality_log.json`
- `fetch_raw()` always returns `(raw, failed_endpoints)` — never raises
- `_fetch_and_assess()` always returns `(label, normalized, summary, fields, val_result)` — never raises
- `_write_assessed()` is only called after downgrade check passes — file never written if API result is inferior
- Downgrade protection is in `garmin_collector.main()` — not in `_upsert_quality()`
- `_save_quality_log()` is called after every individual day — every day is an atomic resume point
- No module reads `os.environ` directly — all config via `garmin_config`

---

## garmin_app.py (Target 1 + 2)

Desktop GUI built with tkinter. Target 2 is distributed as a PyInstaller `.exe` — `scripts/` must stay next to it at runtime.

### Key design decisions

**Script execution** — scripts run as subprocesses via locally installed `python.exe`. `_find_python()` searches PATH and common Windows install locations. `_build_env()` sets all `GARMIN_*` ENV variables before launch.

**Configuration** — all config passed via `os.environ`. `_build_env()` builds the full env dict from UI settings. No source patching, no temp files.

**Password security** — stored in Windows Credential Manager via `keyring`. Never written to disk. Passed to subprocesses via `GARMIN_PASSWORD` env var only.

**Token persistence** — after first SSO login, `garmin_security.save_token()` encrypts the OAuth token with AES-256-GCM. Library writes `garmin_tokens.json` to `GARMIN_TOKEN_DIR` — `save_token()` reads, encrypts, writes `.enc`, removes dir. On subsequent runs, `load_token()` decrypts and writes the file back for the library — removed immediately after login. The encryption key is stored in WCM under `GarminLocalArchive / token_enc_key`.

**Stop button** — `self._active_proc` holds subprocess reference. `_stop_collector()` calls `proc.terminate()`, waits 5s, then `proc.kill()`.

**Background Timer** — daemon thread cycling: Repair → Quality → Fill. Repair re-fetches `failed` days, Quality re-checks `low` days, Fill fetches completely missing days. Each mode draws a random subset. Timer pauses during manual sync and resumes afterwards.

**Thread safety** — timer threads carry a `generation` integer. `_timer_generation` increments on Start/Stop — stale threads exit immediately.

---

## garmin_app_standalone.py (Target 3)

No subprocesses — runs collector in a thread via `_run_module()`. Uses `importlib` to load modules dynamically from `sys._MEIPASS/scripts/`. Stop handled via `threading.Event` injected into module globals.

---

## `test_local.py`

**Current count: 199 checks, 13 sections.**

```bash
python tests/test_local.py
```

### What is tested

1. `garmin_config` — ENV parsing, path derivation, constants
2. `garmin_sync` — all three sync modes, `date_range()`, `get_local_dates()`
3. `garmin_normalizer` — `normalize()`, `safe_get()`, `_parse_list_values()`, `summarize()`
4. `garmin_quality` — all four quality levels, upsert, round-trip, migrations, thread safety
5. `garmin_writer` — `write_day()`, file content, `read_raw()`
6. `garmin_collector` internals — `_process_day()` tuple, `val_result` structure
7. `garmin_validator` — schema load, all issue types, status escalation
8. `garmin_writer` — `read_raw()` edge cases, `_should_write()`, `_is_stopped()`
9. `garmin_security` — AES key derivation, save/load round-trip, wrong key, clear
10. `garmin_utils` — `parse_device_date()`, `parse_sync_dates()`
11. `INVARIANTS` — `fetch_raw` return type, `_process_day` tuple length, write-only ownership
12. `ROBUSTNESS` — empty raw, corrupt JSON, stop event, non-dict input
13. `PIPELINE_E2E` — full day through pipeline: write → quality → read

### What is NOT tested

- GUI (tkinter) — verified manually before release
- `garmin_api` — requires live Garmin Connect credentials
- `garmin_import` — requires actual Garmin GDPR export ZIP
- Export scripts in `export/`
- Full end-to-end with real API data

### When to run

After any change to: `garmin_config`, `garmin_sync`, `garmin_normalizer`, `garmin_quality`, `garmin_writer`, `garmin_collector`, `garmin_security`, `garmin_utils`, `garmin_validator`.

---

## Common tasks

### Adding a new Garmin API endpoint

In `garmin_api.py`, append to `endpoints` in `fetch_raw()`:
```python
("get_method_name", (date_str,), "key_name"),
```

### Adding a new summary field

1. Add extraction logic to `summarize()` in `garmin_normalizer.py`
2. Run `export/regenerate_summaries.py` to backfill existing files

### Adding a new quality field

Add the endpoint key to `assess_quality_fields()` in `garmin_quality.py`.

### Updating the schema

1. Edit `garmin/garmin_dataformat.json`
2. Increment `schema_version` (minor for optional fields, major for required)
3. Update `CURRENT_SCHEMA_VERSION` in `garmin_normalizer.py` if summary schema changes
4. Self-healing loop will revalidate affected days on next run automatically

## Quality tracking

Every downloaded file is assessed immediately. Result stored in `quality_log.json`.

**Why content-based quality:**
Garmin stores intraday detail for ~1–2 years. Older data returns daily aggregates only — valid JSON, far less content. File size is unreliable. Content inspection is the only safe method.

**Quality levels:**

| Level | Condition | Background Timer |
|---|---|---|
| `high` | Intraday data present (`heartRateValues` or `stressValuesArray` has entries) | Never re-downloaded |
| `medium` | Daily aggregates present, no intraday — as good as it gets | Never re-downloaded |
| `low` | Minimal stats only | Re-tried up to `LOW_QUALITY_MAX_ATTEMPTS` times |
| `failed` | API error — no usable data | Re-tried until successful |

**Downgrade protection:** `high` stays `high`. No legitimate path exists for a `high` day to become lower quality.

---

## Sync modes

| Mode | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| `"recent"` | Last `SYNC_DAYS` days (default 90) |
| `"range"` | `SYNC_FROM` to `SYNC_TO` |
| `"auto"` | `first_day` → today. `first_day` detected once, stored permanently |

---

## Chunked sync

`SYNC_CHUNK_SIZE` (default 10) — days processed per chunk before `quality_log.json` is flushed. If interrupted, next run resumes from first unwritten day. Set to `0` for single-pass. Does not affect `run_import()`.

---

## Known Garmin API quirks

- `get_fitnessAge()` does not exist in current `garminconnect` versions — removed.
- `get_devices()` may return non-dict entries — filtered with `isinstance(d, dict)`.
- **Stress data:** `stress.stressValuesArray` as `[ts_ms, value]` pairs. Subtract `stressChartValueOffset` if present. Negative = unmeasured, filtered out.
- **Body Battery:** `stress.bodyBatteryValuesArray` as `[ts_ms, "MEASURED", level, version]`. Level at index 2.
- Login may require browser captcha on first run or after long inactivity — run manually in terminal.

---

## Session log behaviour

- Manual syncs: `log/recent/garmin_YYYY-MM-DD_HHMMSS.log`
- Background timer: `log/recent/garmin_background_YYYY-MM-DD_HHMMSS.log`
- Error sessions additionally copied to `log/fail/`
- `log/recent/` capped at 30 files — oldest deleted automatically
- `log/fail/` has no automatic limit
- Always written at DEBUG regardless of GUI log toggle
