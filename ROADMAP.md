# Garmin Local Archive — Roadmap

> This is a hobby project built and maintained by one person without a programming background.
> There are no deadlines, no guarantees, and no support obligations.
> Features get built when they get built.

## Currently stable — v1.1.2

- Local archiving of Garmin Connect health data
- Three sync modes: recent, range, auto
- Excel exports (daily overview + intraday timeseries)
- Interactive HTML dashboards (timeseries + analysis)
- Analysis dashboard with personal baseline and age/fitness reference ranges
- JSON export for local AI tools (Ollama / AnythingLLM / Open WebUI)
- Desktop GUI with connection test, log toggle, sync mode field dimming
- Three targets: scripts only, standard EXE (Python required), standalone EXE (no Python required)
- **Quality tracking** — every downloaded raw file is assessed for content quality (`high/med/low/failed`) and registered in `log/quality_log.json`. Content-based assessment replaces the old file-size heuristic, correctly handling the Garmin data retention limit (~1–2 years of intraday detail). Days with `recheck=true` are re-downloaded by the background timer; after `LOW_QUALITY_MAX_ATTEMPTS` (default 3) failed attempts a `low` day is left alone permanently.
- **Background Timer** — automatic background sync that cycles through three modes per run: Repair (API failures → `failed`), Quality (low-content days → `low`), Fill (true gaps never downloaded). Configurable interval and days-per-run. Live countdown and progress in the button. Connection test before first run. Stops cleanly on app close or when archive is complete. Background sessions logged with `garmin_background_` prefix.
- **Session logging** — every sync writes a full DEBUG log to `log/recent/`; sessions with errors or low-quality downloads are additionally copied to `log/fail/`
- **First Day Patch** — `first_day` anchor stored in `quality_log.json`. Detected once on first run (devices → account profile → fallback → oldest local file), never overwritten. Auto mode and background timer use it directly as the lower bound — no repeated API calls. Device history (`name`, `id`, `first_used`, `last_used`) stored alongside and refreshed on every login. One-time backfill on upgrade populates all existing `high`/`med` days that were previously missing from the quality log. **Clean Archive** button in the GUI opens a preview popup and removes all files and log entries before `first_day` on confirm.

## Planned — v1.1 (remaining)

### 4. Version Check on Startup

Checks GitHub for a newer release on app start and notifies the user if one is available.

- GitHub API: `GET /repos/Wewoc/Garmin_Local_Archive/releases/latest` → compare `tag_name` with embedded `APP_VERSION` constant
- Runs in a background thread — non-blocking
- No internet: silently ignored
- Notification: popup or log entry (not yet decided)
- Version definition: constant in app files or external `version.txt` (not yet decided)

### 5. Schema Versioning

A `schema_version` field in `summary/garmin_YYYY-MM-DD.json`. Makes it possible to detect when summaries were generated with an older version of `summarize()` and flag them for regeneration.

`CURRENT_SCHEMA_VERSION` in `garmin_collector.py` is the single source of truth. When the `summarize()` function changes in a way that affects output fields, the version is incremented. Smart Regeneration (v1.2) then picks up any summary where `schema_version < CURRENT_SCHEMA_VERSION`.

**Coupling with Quality Tracking:** days with `quality=low` or `quality=failed` in `quality_log.json` can be treated as `schema_version: 0` — permanently below any real version. Smart Regeneration will always include them once their raw file is complete.

### 6. Include-today Flag

An optional `INCLUDE_TODAY` flag that allows syncing today's incomplete data. Currently today is always excluded because the data is partial — this flag makes it opt-in.

### 7. Analysis Dashboard — Flagged Day Tooltips

Small UX improvement: hovering over a flagged day marker in the Analysis Dashboard shows the exact value and why it was flagged (above/below reference range, distance from baseline).

### 7b. MFA / Captcha Hint in GUI

When login fails with an authentication error (401/403 or MFA challenge), the GUI shows a specific, actionable hint in the log instead of just the raw error — especially important for the Standalone version where no terminal is available.

Target output in the log:
```
✗ Login failed — Garmin may require browser verification.
  → Download the Standard version, run garmin_collector.py once
    in a terminal to complete MFA, then use Standalone normally.
```

### 8. Archive Info Panel

A compact read-only info panel in the GUI (right panel) showing the current state of the local archive at a glance:

- Total days tracked in `quality_log.json`
- Breakdown by quality: `high / med / low / failed`
- Days with `recheck=true` (pending background timer work)
- Earliest and latest date in `raw/`
- Archive completeness: days present vs. possible days in range (%)
- Last sync timestamp

Reads directly from `quality_log.json` and `raw/` — no API call needed. Updates after every sync. Gives the user full transparency over what the background timer is doing and how complete the archive is.

## Planned — v1.2

### Dashboard Architecture Refactoring

Transition from individual scripts to a master/specialist model:

- `garmin_dashboard_base.py` — shared frame: CSS, Dark Mode, Header, Disclaimer, Footer, Plotly integration, tab navigation
- `garmin_content_timeseries.py` — intraday metrics (HR, Stress, SpO2, Body Battery, Respiration) from `raw/`
- `garmin_content_health.py` — HRV, Resting HR, Stress, Body Battery with baseline + reference ranges from `summary/`
- `garmin_content_sleep.py` — Sleep total, Deep, REM, Sleep score, HRV night from `summary/`
- `garmin_content_activity.py` — Steps, Distance, Training load, Readiness, VO2max from `summary/`

**Why this order matters:** Remaining v1.1 items first — a beautiful modular dashboard on top of incomplete data is still incomplete data. v1.2 refactors the architecture, v1.3 adds the new dashboards on the clean base.

**Benefits:**
- Design changes in one place — applies to all dashboards
- Disclaimer updated once — everywhere
- New dashboard = new specialist script, base untouched
- Claude-efficient: a specialist script is ~300 lines vs. a 2000-line monolith — future sessions only load the relevant file, which reduces token usage and keeps the full context window available for actual work

### Smart Regeneration

Automatic detection of summaries that were generated with an older `schema_version` and re-running `summarize()` on the corresponding raw files — without hitting the Garmin API again.

Builds directly on Schema Versioning (v1.1 #4) and extends the existing `regenerate_summaries.py`. The logic: scan all `summary/` files, compare `schema_version` against the current version, collect outdated entries, regenerate in batch. Clean runs produce no output.

## Under consideration — v2.0

These are ideas, not commitments. Some may never get built.

**Multiple Garmin accounts**
Currently one account per Windows user. Switching between accounts requires manually changing credentials in Settings. Multi-account support would allow profiles per user.

**External factors & correlations**
Import external data (weather, activity logs, custom notes) and correlate with health metrics. Did poor sleep correlate with high stress? Did training load predict HRV drops?

**Adaptive Baselines**
Extend the Analysis Dashboard beyond fixed 90-day baselines. Rolling windows (7-day, 30-day), seasonal patterns, and load vs. recovery phase detection. The raw data is already there — this is purely an analytical layer on top of `garmin_analysis_html.py`.

**AI health report PDF**
Generate a formatted PDF health summary using the local AI model — personal baseline, flagged days, trends. Fully local, no cloud.

**Route heatmap**
Generate a local heatmap of GPS routes from activity data. No third-party mapping services.

**Windows notifications**
Toast notifications for sync completion, failed days, or significant metric changes.

**Stats dashboard & session log analysis**
Local overview of archive health built from session logs — days synced vs failed over time, which API endpoints fail most often, Garmin API response patterns by time of day. Builds on the Archive Info Panel (v1.1 #7) and the quality data in `quality_log.json`. No extra API calls needed.

## Post-release tasks

- **Screenshots** — 2–3 GUI screenshots + Dashboard screenshots in README.md einbauen sobald v1.1.1 stabil im Repo ist

---

## Not planned

- Cloud sync or remote access
- Mobile app
- Automatic data sharing, cloud sync, or social comparison features
- Support for non-Windows platforms (currently Windows only)
- Code signing or automatic updates

**Activities dashboard**
Training load, activity volume and sport-specific metrics (swim/bike/run) visualised over time. Activity data is already collected by the collector — it just isn't used beyond the summary. Would provide additional context for AI training recommendations.
