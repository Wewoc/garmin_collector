# Garmin Local Archive — Desktop App (Standard) v1.3.0

## What this is

`Garmin_Local_Archive.exe` is a desktop launcher for all Garmin Local Archive scripts.
No terminal, no text editor — configure everything in the UI and click to run.

**This version requires Python to be installed on your machine.**
If you don't have Python or don't want to install it, use the Standalone version instead —
see `README_APP_Standalone.md`.

---

## First-time setup

### Step 1 — Extract the ZIP

Download `Garmin_Local_Archive.zip` and extract it. The folder must contain:

```
Garmin_Local_Archive.exe     ← double-click to launch
scripts/                     ← all .py files — must stay next to the .exe
info/                        ← documentation (optional)
```

> `scripts/` is required. Without it no buttons will work.

### Step 2 — Install Python and dependencies

1. Download Python 3.10 or newer from https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Run the installer — tick **"Add Python to PATH"**
3. Open a terminal and run:

```bash
pip install garminconnect openpyxl keyring
```

### Step 3 — Run the app

Double-click `Garmin_Local_Archive.exe`.

> Windows may show a security warning ("Windows protected your PC"). Click **More info** → **Run anyway**. This happens because the .exe is not code-signed. The source code is open — you can review it before running.

### Step 4 — Fill in your settings

Left panel:
- **Email** — your Garmin Connect login email
- **Password** — your Garmin Connect password (stored securely in the Windows Credential Manager, never written to disk as plain text)
- **Data folder** — where to store data (e.g. `C:\Users\YourName\garmin_data`)
- **Sync mode** — `recent` for daily use, `range` for a specific period, `auto` for full history
- **Export date range** — used by all export scripts. Leave empty to use the oldest/newest file in your archive automatically
- **Age / Sex** — used by the Analysis Dashboard for reference ranges

Click **Save Settings** — settings are remembered between sessions.

## Buttons

### Test Connection
Tests the connection to Garmin Connect. Shows three indicators:

- **Login** — credentials valid, session established
- **API Access** — Garmin API is reachable and responding
- **Data** — data endpoint returns results

Each indicator turns green on success or red on failure. The button itself turns green if all three pass, red if any fail.

The test also runs automatically the first time you click Sync Data. After a successful test the result is remembered for the session — subsequent syncs start immediately without re-testing. The test resets when you restart the app.

### Clean Archive
Removes all data files that predate your `first_day` — the earliest valid day detected in your Garmin account.

Click the button to open a preview popup showing exactly which files will be deleted and how many quality log entries will be removed. Nothing is deleted until you confirm with **Delete**. Click **Cancel** to close without changes.

Use this to clean up files created accidentally by entering a date that is too early in range mode. The `first_day` anchor is detected automatically on first run and stored in `log/quality_log.json`. If the popup reports "nothing to clean", your archive is already consistent.

### Sync Data / Stop
Downloads missing days from Garmin Connect. Watch the log at the bottom for progress.
First run may take a while depending on how far back you go.
Click **Stop** to cancel a running sync at any time.

If there are days with failed or incomplete downloads in the selected sync range, a popup will appear before the sync starts: **"Incomplete records found: X days in the selected range — Refresh now?"** Click **Yes** to re-fetch those days, or **No** to skip them and sync normally.

> **Large archives:** If you have years of Garmin history, start with `range` mode for the last 1–2 years before using `auto`. Downloading everything at once can trigger Garmin rate limiting.

### Import Bulk Export
Imports a Garmin GDPR data export into your local archive — useful for historical data that is no longer available via the API (Garmin degrades intraday data after ~1–2 years).

1. Go to [garmin.com](https://www.garmin.com/en-US/account/datamanagement/exportdata/) → Request Data Export
2. Wait for the email (typically 20–30 minutes), download the ZIP
3. Click **📥 Import Bulk Export** — choose ZIP file or unpacked folder
4. Progress is shown in the log window

Imported days land in `raw/` and `summary/` alongside API data. Days already present with `high` or `medium` quality from the API are skipped — the better source wins. Imported data is marked `source: bulk` in the quality log and never re-fetched automatically.

### Background Timer
Automatically repairs and fills your archive in the background while the app is open — no manual intervention needed.

Click the **⏱ Timer: Off** button to start. The button turns green and shows a live countdown to the next run. While a sync is running it shows **"Syncing · N offen"**.

The timer alternates between two modes each run:
- **Repair** — re-fetches days listed in `log/failed_days.json` (API errors and incomplete files)
- **Fill** — fetches completely missing days between your earliest local file and yesterday

When both queues are empty the timer stops automatically and logs "Archive complete".

**Settings** (shown next to the button):

| Field | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Min. Interval (min) | 5 | Shortest wait between runs |
| Max. Interval (min) | 30 | Longest wait between runs |
| Min. Days per Run | 3 | Fewest days fetched per run |
| Max. Days per Run | 10 | Most days fetched per run |

The timer runs its own connection test before the first sync. If successful, the Test Connection indicators also turn green. Clicking the timer button while a sync is running stops the current download immediately.

### Daily Overview
Exports `garmin_export.xlsx` — one row per day, colour-coded by category.
Reads from `summary/`.

### Timeseries Excel
Exports `garmin_timeseries.xlsx` — full intraday data + charts per metric.
Reads from `raw/`. Uses the Export Date Range from settings.

### Timeseries Dashboard
Generates `garmin_dashboard.html` — open in any browser.
Reads from `raw/`. Uses the Export Date Range from settings.

### Analysis Dashboard
Generates `garmin_analysis.html` + `garmin_analysis.json`.
Shows daily values vs your 90-day baseline vs age/fitness reference ranges.
Reads from `summary/`. The JSON file can be uploaded to Ollama / Open WebUI for AI-assisted interpretation.

### Log: Simple / Log: Detailed
Toggles the log output level in the GUI. **Simple** shows only key steps (default). **Detailed** shows every API call — useful for diagnosing connection issues or Garmin API changes.

If you toggle while a sync is running, a yellow notice appears above the button: **"Takes effect on next sync"**. The current sync continues unchanged and the notice disappears automatically when the next sync starts.

Session log files (in `log/recent/` and `log/fail/`) always record at full detail regardless of this toggle.

### Open Data Folder
Opens your data folder in Windows Explorer.

### Open Last HTML
Opens the most recently generated HTML file in your default browser.

## Session logs

Every sync automatically writes a detailed log to your data folder:

```
garmin_data/
└── log/
    ├── recent/    – last 30 sync sessions (always full detail)
    └── fail/      – sessions with errors or incomplete days (kept permanently)
```

Manual sync sessions are named `garmin_YYYY-MM-DD_HHMMSS.log`. Background timer sessions are named `garmin_background_YYYY-MM-DD_HHMMSS.log` — the prefix makes the source immediately identifiable in `log/fail/`.

These are plain text files — open them in any text editor if you need to diagnose a problem.

---

## Password security

Your password is stored in the **Windows Credential Manager** (the same secure vault used by browsers and Windows itself). It is:

- Encrypted by Windows using your login credentials
- Never written to any file on disk
- Only readable by your Windows user account

To remove the stored password: open Windows Credential Manager → Windows Credentials → find `GarminLocalArchive` → delete.

---

## Settings file

All settings except the password are saved to:

```
C:\Users\YourName\.garmin_archive_settings.json
```

Delete this file to reset all settings to defaults. The password must be cleared separately via the Windows Credential Manager.

## Building from source

To rebuild after modifying scripts:

1. Place `build.py`, `build_standalone.py`, and all `garmin_*.py` scripts in the same folder
2. Run:

```bash
python build.py
```

`build.py` will automatically:
- Install PyInstaller and keyring if missing
- Move scripts to `scripts/` and docs to `info/`
- Build `Garmin_Local_Archive.exe`
- Create `Garmin_Local_Archive.zip` ready for distribution

To build the Standalone version instead:

```bash
python build_standalone.py
```

---

## Troubleshooting

**App doesn't start** — make sure the `scripts/` folder is in the same folder as the `.exe` and contains all `garmin_*.py` files.

**Script not found error** — a `garmin_*.py` file is missing from `scripts/`. Check all files are present.

**Login fails** — run `garmin_collector.py` directly in a terminal once to complete any captcha or MFA verification, then use the app normally.

**Log shows errors but no data** — check your email/password in Settings and make sure the data folder path is valid.

**Password not saved between sessions** — click Save Settings after entering your password. If keyring is unavailable, install it: `pip install keyring`.

**Stress / Body Battery missing from Excel or dashboard** — run `regenerate_summaries.py` once to rebuild all summary files from raw data.
